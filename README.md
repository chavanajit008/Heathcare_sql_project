# Healthcare Data SQL Analysis

1. Analyzed multi-hospital patient data using SQL.

**Dataset:** Healthcare patient records from Kaggle

**Questions explored:**
- Total patient count
- Average patient age  
- Distribution of medical conditions
- Hospital admission patterns

**Finding:** High diversity across conditions and hospitals, no single dominant pattern.

2. Analyzed the same dataset using MS Excel and also made a few pivot tables and charts to understand the data better.
